# A simple personal website by LÃ©o Gonsalves
Starter code used at a 'web basics' presentation I gave at the Association for Computer Machinery.

## Contents
This repository contains the starter code in the main branch, and the finished product in the finished branch. Please clone whichever one you'd like to look at.

## Purpose
This is part of a presentation I gave at ACM and was used to guide students through the basics of creating a website with a style, content, and a script that modifies the contents.

It is not in any way designed to give users a deep understanding of any of those concepts, but rather to open doors for exploration.

## The Code
The code demonstrates the following concepts:
* links (anchors) to other websites and other files in the same website
* importing images and styling them
* flexbox usage
* positioning of elements in the DOM
* demonstration of simple css styling
* live updating of webpage html through vanilla javascript
